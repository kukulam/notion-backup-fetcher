# notion-backup-fetcher

## Description
Script is responsible for fetching notion pages. Main goal of this project is to fetch notion workspace and save it into google drive. Notion is not able to work offline and sometimes during travelling I don't have internet connection. Using fetched files I am able to use files in read-only mode.
